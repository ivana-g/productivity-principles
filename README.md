## Child-like wonder 
"Almost everybody can stay excited for 2 or 3 months. A few people can stay excited for 2 or 3 years. But a winner can stay excited for 30 years or however long it takes to win." - Art Williams

## Optimizing work - eliminating tasks
"Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is eliminate the task.

Downsize. The rooms you don't have, don't need to be cleaned.

Donate. The items you don't own, don't need to be organized.

Delete. The projects you don't take on, don't need to be finished.

**Is this a problem that needs to be solved? Or is it a problem that can be eliminated all together?"**
