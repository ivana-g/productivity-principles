## Child-like wonder 
"Almost everybody can stay excited for 2 or 3 months. A few people can stay excited for 2 or 3 years. But a winner can stay excited for 30 years or however long it takes to win." - Art Williams

## Optimizing work - eliminating tasks
"Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is eliminate the task.

Downsize. The rooms you don't have, don't need to be cleaned.

Donate. The items you don't own, don't need to be organized.

Delete. The projects you don't take on, don't need to be finished.

**Is this a problem that needs to be solved? Or is it a problem that can be eliminated all together?"**

 ## A poem to be a happier human

Why chase perfection when your joy loves progress?

Why seek to be liked by the mass when too many within it don’t like themselves?

Why aim to fit in when the game is to be a standout?

Why wish for easier times when it’s the hard ones that make you strong?


To turn trials into triumph.

To make failure into fortune.

To change wounds into wisdom. 

To reform walls into windows.

Such are the things that make humans.

Happier.


So as the hours of your life advance.

As the months slip away.

As the years become decades.

As the clock ticks each day.


Walk the earth gently.

Care for the planet carefully.

Honor your values ferociously.

Protect your ambitions enthusiastically.

Celebrate your friends passionately.

Hold your family closely.

Guard great health excellently.

And be helpful to many, daily.


Do this.

And.

You’ll.

Become.

Magic.

And a whole lot.

Happier.

## Lucky breaks 
Develop my skills. Study my craft. Save some money. Build a network before I need it. Lay the ground work.

The prepared person is positioned to benefit from unexpected opportunities.

## The value of questions
Is your reading and research supplementing your actions or substituting for them? 

Research is useful until it becomes a form of procrastination.

## Life rewards courage.

The person who is brave enough to bet on something or someone—as long as they avoid irreversible mistakes like running out of cash or going to jail—is in a position to win.
