## Child-like wonder 
"Almost everybody can stay excited for 2 or 3 months. A few people can stay excited for 2 or 3 years. But a winner can stay excited for 30 years or however long it takes to win." - Art Williams

## Optimizing work - eliminating tasks
"Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is eliminate the task.

Downsize. The rooms you don't have, don't need to be cleaned.

Donate. The items you don't own, don't need to be organized.

Delete. The projects you don't take on, don't need to be finished.

**Is this a problem that needs to be solved? Or is it a problem that can be eliminated all together?"**

 ## A poem to be a happier human

Why chase perfection when your joy loves progress?

Why seek to be liked by the mass when too many within it don’t like themselves?

Why aim to fit in when the game is to be a standout?

Why wish for easier times when it’s the hard ones that make you strong?


To turn trials into triumph.

To make failure into fortune.

To change wounds into wisdom. 

To reform walls into windows.

Such are the things that make humans.

Happier.


So as the hours of your life advance.

As the months slip away.

As the years become decades.

As the clock ticks each day.


Walk the earth gently.

Care for the planet carefully.

Honor your values ferociously.

Protect your ambitions enthusiastically.

Celebrate your friends passionately.

Hold your family closely.

Guard great health excellently.

And be helpful to many, daily.


Do this.

And.

You’ll.

Become.

Magic.

And a whole lot.

Happier.

## Lucky breaks 
Develop my skills. Study my craft. Save some money. Build a network before I need it. Lay the ground work.

The prepared person is positioned to benefit from unexpected opportunities.

## The value of questions
Is your reading and research supplementing your actions or substituting for them? 

Research is useful until it becomes a form of procrastination.

## Life rewards courage.

The person who is brave enough to bet on something or someone—as long as they avoid irreversible mistakes like running out of cash or going to jail—is in a position to win.

## The power of small acts
"Whether or not something is deemed a "failure" is dependent on when performance is measured.

I signed the book deal for Atomic Habits in November 2015 and it was published in October 2018. If you were to measure the performance of the book at any point during those three years, the project would have been deemed a failure. In January 2016? It was incomplete. A failure. In August 2017? Still unfinished. A failure. In February 2018? Again, a failure.

But after October 2018, it looked like a success. Same project. Different time when the outcome was measured.

This idea applies in many areas of life. You're not failing. You're just in the middle of succeeding." - James Clear

## Mistakes 
"Regard yourself as a cloud, in the flesh, because you see, clouds never make mistakes. Did you ever see a cloud that was misshapen? Did you ever see a badly designed wave? No, they always do the right thing. But, if you will, treat yourself for a while as a cloud or a wave and realize that you can’t make a mistake whatever you do. Because even if you do something that appears totally disastrous, it will all come out in the wash somehow or another. Then through this capacity you will develop a kind of confidence. And through confidence you will be able to trust your own intuition." - Alan Watts

## The connection between action and satisfaction
"Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's a day you've had everything to do and you've done it." - Margaret Thatcher src: Quoted in "As I Said to Denis: The Margaret Thatcher Book of Quotations"

Formal education is not nearly as important as an unquenchable thirst to learn.

## Mental toughness
Mental toughness is often portrayed as determination and persistence, but it can also be flexibility and adaptability.

 - I can be happy anywhere.

 - I can work with what I have.

 - I can have a good day with anyone.

**You are tough when your mood is not dependent on your conditions.**

Nearly everything awesome takes longer than you think.

  Get started and don't worry about the clock.
  
## Financial advice from a grandmother 
When you buy something cheap the best you'll feel about it is when you buy it. 

When you buy something nice and expensive the worst you'll feel about it when you buy it.  

## Tradeoffs 
Life is a series of tradeoffs, and greater results usually require greater tradeoffs.

The question is not, "Do you want to be great at this?"

The question is, "What are you willing to give up in order to be great at this?

## Commitment 
Until one is committed there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always inneffectivness. Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills thousands of ideas and countless plans. 

## Hard becomes easy and easy becomes hard
By choosing hard projects and hard books to read and hard workouts to do and hard ambitions to pursue, the struggle will make you stronger, braver and better.This eventually makes for a happier, healthier and easier life.

And in choosing a life of pleasure, trivial pursuits and lightness in all cases, the pain of your potential unrealized creates deep and lasting hardship.

So when faced with a choice, always select the path of most resistance. It’ll make you great.

## Accepting the reality of slow progress 
- Before I try to increase my willpower, I need to try to decrease the friction in my environment.
- Most big, deeply satisfying accomplishments in life take at least five years to achieve. This can include building a business, cultivating a loving relationship, writing a book, getting in the best shape of your life, raising a family, and more.

Five years is a long time. It is much slower than most of us would like. If you accept the reality of slow progress, you have every reason to take action today. If you resist the reality of slow progress, five years from now you'll simply be five years older and still looking for a shortcut.

## The opinion of others 
"If you care too much about being praised, in the end you will not accomplish anything serious.
...
Let the judgments of others be the consequence of your deeds, not their purpose." - Leo Tolstoy

## A gift to myself 
"Stop what you're doing. Close your eyes.

For the next 60 seconds, just breathe."
